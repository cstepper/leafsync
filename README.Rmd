`leafsync` is a plugin for [`leaflet`](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet) to produce potentially synchronised small multiples of leaflet web maps wrapping [`Leaflet.Sync`](https://github.com/jieter/Leaflet.Sync).


## Installation

You can install the released version of leafsync from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("leafsync")
```

## Example

``` r
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(mapview)

data(meuse)
coordinates(meuse) <- ~x+y
proj4string(meuse) <- CRS("+init=epsg:28992")

## view different aspects of same data set
m1 <- mapview(meuse, zcol = "soil", burst = TRUE)
m2 <- mapview(meuse, zcol = "lead")
m3 <- mapview(meuse, zcol = "landuse", map.types = "Esri.WorldImagery")
m4 <- mapview(meuse, zcol = "dist.m")

sync(m1, m2, m3, m4) # 4 panels synchronised
```
